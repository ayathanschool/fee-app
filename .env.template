# Fee Collection API Configuration
# =============================
# Copy this file to .env in the project root and set the values
# NOTE: Vite reads these values at build time

# API Key - Must match the one in Apps Script Script Properties
# This is used to authenticate API requests to the Google Apps Script
VITE_API_KEY=feemgr-2025

# For development, the GAS endpoint is proxied through /gas
# In production, this endpoint is hardcoded in src/api.js
# If you're having authentication or connection issues, check:
# 1. That the API key matches between frontend and GAS
# 2. That the deployment URL in vite.config.js matches your current GAS deployment
# 3. That the GAS Web App is deployed with "Execute as: Me" and "Who has access: Anyone"
